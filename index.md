Hi! My name is Xinyuan (Yolanda) Zhou, a sophomore at Cornell University pursuing a major in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering and potentially double minors in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Computer Science.

My interests are robotic control and integration, PCB design, aerodynamic simulation, and machine learning.


Take a look at <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
